# High-Performance Networks

Welcome to the High-Performance Data Networking Course repository! This advanced networking course explores the concept of network programmability and fundamental networking concepts such as Quality of Service (QoS) and network resilience. Whether you're a student or a professional in the field of networking, this course will provide you with the knowledge and skills to understand and apply programmable network technologies effectively.

## Course Contents

In this course, we will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to network programmability
- Quality of Service (QoS) in networks
- Network resilience and fault tolerance
- Hands-on experience with programmable network technologies
- Implementation and simulation using network emulators (e.g., Mininet)

## Study Goals

The learning objectives of this course are twofold:

1. Gain knowledge of the treated networking technologies, including network programmability, QoS, and network resilience.
2. Develop the ability to apply and work with programmable network technologies in a network emulator (such as Mininet).

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, simply clone this repository and explore the materials provided. You will find lecture notes, practical exercises, and assignments to help you understand and apply the concepts covered in the course.

Feel free to engage with the community through discussions, share your implementations, and collaborate with fellow learners to deepen your understanding of high-performance data networking and network programmability.

We hope you find this course valuable and enjoy your learning journey!
